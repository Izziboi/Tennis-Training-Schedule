## Introduction
<p align="justify">
One day, I went to nuy some food stuffs and briefly overhead a customer discussing about Excel with the shop operator. It cut my interest but not seriously at first. After my shopping, I decided to ask the shop operator what the fellow was talking about. He explained that he wanted an Excel sheet that could help him make some schedules. I later got in contact with the fellow and it turned out that he was a Lawn Tennis Coach. He actually needed an Excel platform he could use to take attendance of his students as well as keep record of their payments. After our discussion, I started working on it according to his specifications and result is what you have on this repository.

## How To Use The Platform
<p align="justify">
There are two ways to use the platform:
  
- Pay-as-you-go<br>
- Recurrent
  
- **Pay-as-you-go:** By this, a trainee does not bother to register with the academy. They only hop in, pay, train until their deposit expires and they leave. In this case, the portion of the platform sjown below is used for them.

At the end of the table, there is no summary. Only the total amount deposited is shown as well as the fee per hour (See below).

- **Recurrent:** This is where the beauty of the platform is appreciated.
